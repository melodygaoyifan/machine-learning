In contemporary healthcare settings, physicians face a significant challenge due to the extensive administrative workload associated with patient documentation. Currently, it is estimated that physicians spend, on average, 15.5 hours per week on administrative tasks such as paperwork reporting and patient documentation (Cass, 2023). With the assistance of automatic speech recognition, physicians can save effort in writing reports after each patientâ€™s visit
The goal of this project is to develop an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system capable of accurately transforming human voice recordings into text. The recordings are sourced from the ACI-bench transcripts, consisting of 25 audio files, which were recorded by students in this program. 
The system will leverage advanced deep-learning techniques to process these recordings and produce corresponding text transcriptions with high accuracy. 
This ASR system aims to facilitate efficient and reliable conversion of spoken language into written form, which can be useful in various applications such as transcription services, voice-activated interfaces, and accessibility tools.
